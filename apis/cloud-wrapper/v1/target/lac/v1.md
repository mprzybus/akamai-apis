## Overview

TBD:
This above-the-fold initial introduction section should consist of
roughly up to a screen full of content, which should provide the basic
marketing pitch for the API. Follow these editorial guidelines for this
[Introductory Text](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#introductory-text)
section. Involve engineers, product managers, and [Developer
Marketing](mailto:devrel@akamai.com) to craft this important,
above-the-fold content.

TBD: For all content in the __OVERVIEW__ section, edit the
`documentation/overview_intro.md` file. Use third-level headings
(`###`) throughout. (Any nested fourth-level headings aren't
available in the site's navbar.)

### Get started

TBD: This section assumes that based on the intro section above, the
customer has decided to go ahead and set up the API.  List any
substantial prerequisites as a series of bullet items.  This includes
anything you need to configure first before running these API
operations: any special permissions you need, any product or add-on
module on your contract, whether you need to contact your service rep,
whether you need to be part of a beta program, any bits of key data
that you need to get from outside the API, or any other API you need
to have already set up.  It includes the following mandatory set of
prerequisite steps common to all Akamai APIs, which you need to adapt.

To configure this API for the first time:

- Review
[Get Started with APIs](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/learn_akamai/getting_started_with_akamai_developers/developer_tools/getstartedapis.html)
for details on how to set up client tokens to access any Akamai API.
These tokens appear as custom hostnames that look like this:
`https://akzz-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.luna.akamaiapis.net`.

- To enable this API, choose the API service named __TBD__, and set
the access level to __TBD__.  (TBD: On the page linked in the previous
item, see the screen shot that appears below this text: _define
READ-WRITE access for the Diagnostic Tools API._ To complete this
__Get Started__ item, you'll need to determine the exact name of
the API service as it appears within the Control Center interface,
along with the necessary permission level. The service name may match
the API's title published in doc, but not necessarily.)

### API concepts

TBD: For most APIs, the top of the [Resources](#resources) section
should be able to summarize all of the conceptual _resources_
customers interact with in the API, conveniently located directly
adjacent to the [API summary](#apisummary) table. For larger, more
complex APIs that may require understanding of other important
concepts, move the content here to the overview section. Otherwise,
handle the content the same way...

Summarize the various resources you interact with and how they
conceptually relate to each other.  Clarify what the underlying
concepts _mean_. Format this as a simple, short, topic/comment list
based around the set of conceptual nouns users need to interact
with. For example:

- __Site__. ...

- __Policy__. ...

- __Custom List__. ...

- __Emergency List__. ...

- __Honeypot__. ...

- __Deployment__. ...

### API workflow

TBD: In addition to the _steps_ that publish for each operation
detailed in the [Resources](#resources) section, doc needs a complete
tutorial that walks through how to use the API, focusing on scenarios
customers find compellingly useful. Make sure any sample data used for
this section is high quality, and reinforces the sample usage this
section discusses.

Note that this section is supplementary. It is _not_ a substitute for
providing all the necessary reference-level details about each
operation, parameter, header, and _steps_ doc in the
[Resources](#resources) section. Likewise, every data member needs to
be fully documented in the [Data](#data) section. Throughout this
section, link to the operations and data objects you're discussing.

### API Features? Remove This and Any Other Headings Below That Don't Apply

TBD: Remove this section. Retain any of the following set of
third-level sections as needed to document common features that may
affect how the user interacts with the API. These _API features_ are
unrelated to the functionality the API allows you to access.  Talk to
the core developers for guidance on whether any of these topics are
relevant to this API. See also the editorial log generated along with
doc, which may identify any likely signs of these features in the
API's descriptors.

### API hypermedia

TBD: Whether JSON data responses feature additional data elements that
tells the client app where they might navigate next. For example, a
list of items may feature a link to the URL to GET each item. Any
`links` members in the data objects indicate hypermedia. See the
[Alerts API](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/alerts/v2.html#hypermedia)
for sample discussion. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#hypermedia)
for guidance.

### Rate limiting

TBD: Whether the API limits the rate of requests, or maintains a total
number of allowed requests over a given time period. The API
typically produces a 429 error when the client exceeds the limit.
It's also standard for APIs to respond with `X-RateLimit-Limit`,
`X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers to provide
the client context over how close it is to the limit. See the
[Diagnostic Tools API](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/diagnostic_tools/v1.html#ratelimiting)
for discussion of a more complex mechanism that rate-limits per
endpoint. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#rate-limiting)
for guidance.

### Resource limiting

TBD: If the API limits the number of objects users can create or
deploy, this is conceptually similar to rate limiting.  (If the API
supports both, title it _Rate and resource limiting_.)  See the
[Property Manager API](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#ratelimiting)
for a sample discussion. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#resource-limiting)
for guidance.

### Concurrency control

TBD: If more than one client might access the same data at the same
time, this feature prevents one from overwriting the other. The API
indicates this with a 412 error. See the
[Property Manager API](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#concurrencycontrol)
for an example. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#concurrency-control)
for guidance.

### Partial PUT objects

TBD: If you GET an object with several members, then when modifying
the object if you can PUT it back with only the subset of members you
want to modify. (Best practice is not to allow this PATCH-like
behavior.)  See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#partial-objects-on-put)
for guidance.

### Partial success responses

TBD: Whether a success response object may also include a section of
`warnings` (structured as HTTP problem detail objects) about issues
that might require attention or otherwise detract from 100% perceived
success. Users may get warnings about issues they need to resolve
before using the data object for some other task. For example, the
[Property Manager API](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#versioning)
users can save rule tree objects in any state, but need to debug them
before activating them. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#partial-success-responses)
for guidance.

### Schema operations

TBD: Whether the API provides separate operations to retrieve data
schema that the client can use to automatically validate input to
other operations. Alternately, whether the API provides links to
schemas as `Link` HTTP headers for operations whose data input users
may want to validate. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#schema)
for guidance.

### Dual data formats

TBD: Whether the API allows you the choice of exchanging data in JSON
or XML formats. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#dual-data-formats)
for guidance.

### Internal versioning

TBD: Whether the API allows you to exchange different versions of a
data object. The
[Property Manager API](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#versioning)
does version control on its rule objects. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#internal-versioning)
for guidance.

### Asynchronous processes

TBD: Whether an API operation may trigger a long-running process whose
progress the client needs to check by polling a separate link that's
available as hypermedia. See the
[API Editorial Guidelines](https://pulsar.akamai.com/user-documentation/requirements/api-editorial-guide/#asynchronous-processes)
for guidance.

## Resources

TBD:
"This section provides details on the API's various operations."

TBD: For content that appears at the top of the __RESOURCES__ tab,
edit the `documentation/resources_intro.md` file. Do _not_ add any
headings within this markdown source file. No headings should appear
above the _API summary_ table in the final publication.

## Data

TBD:
This section provides details for each type of data object the API
exchanges.

TBD: For content that appears at the top of the __DATA__ section, edit
the `documentation/data_intro.md` file. Do _not_ add any headings
within the markdown source file. No headings should appear above the
series of data schema tables in the final publication.

## Errors

TBD:
This section provides details on the data object that reflects the
API's common response to error cases, and lists the API's range of
response status codes for both error and success cases.

TBD: For content in the __ERRORS__ section, edit the
`documentation/errors_intro.md` file. Use third-level headings (`###`)
throughout. (Any nested fourth-level headings aren't available in the
site's navbar.)

### Error responses

TBD: Embed a typical error JSON object below. If the API's error
response objects that adhere to the [HTTP Problem
Details](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) standard, say so here
along with the link above. If not, describe the example below. Also,
if problem-specific URLs included in the response object link to
functioning web pages, say so here.

```json
{
    "tbd": "insert sample response object for a typical error scenario"
}
```

### HTTP status codes

TBD: "This section lists the full range of response codes the API may
generate."  Modify and trim out this table to reflect the full range
of possible responses. Modify the description so that each response
better relates to the context in which it occurs for the current API,
e.g., that a 204 response indicates an item successfully removed.
Note that errors such as 412 and 429 that indicate important API
features should link to corresponding Overview sections, as in the
sample table below. Make sure for any link, there is a corresponding
section of content.

| Code | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [200](https://httpstatuses.com/200) | TBD: The operation succeeded. |
| [201](https://httpstatuses.com/201) | TBD: Resource successfully created. |
| [202](https://httpstatuses.com/202) | TBD: Request accepted, but not yet processed. |
| [204](https://httpstatuses.com/204) | TBD: Successfully processed request. |
| [207](https://httpstatuses.com/207) | TBD: A batch of operations produced a mix of success and failure outcomes. |
| [300](https://httpstatuses.com/300) | TBD: Response offers a choice of redirect options. |
| [301](https://httpstatuses.com/301) | TBD: The requested resource has permanently moved to the link provided. |
| [302](https://httpstatuses.com/302) | TBD: The requested resource is temporarily available at the link provided. |
| [303](https://httpstatuses.com/303) | TBD: The requested resource is available at the link provided. |
| [400](https://httpstatuses.com/400) | TBD: Bad Request. This typically occurs due to a problem with the format of request data, such as an non-parsing or invalid body of data, or an invalid set of query parameters or values. |
| [401](https://httpstatuses.com/401) | TBD: API authentication failure. See [Get started](#getstarted) for guidance on how to correctly set up your API hostname token. |
| [403](https://httpstatuses.com/403) | TBD: No permission to access this resource. This most likely reflects a limitation on the identity of the Control Panel user corresponding to the API client. See [Get started](#getstarted) to make sure you have permission to access all the functionality you need. |
| [404](https://httpstatuses.com/404) | TBD: Resource not found. This typically occurs when a resource keyed by a URL path parameter no longer exists, or if the request URL is garbled in some other way. |
| [405](https://httpstatuses.com/405) | TBD: Method not supported. This typically occurs when the URL you are calling responds to GET requests, but not PUT or DELETE. |
| [408](https://httpstatuses.com/408) | TBD: Request timeout. This typically occurs when sending request data in batches, and failing to close out the request before the server timed out. |
| [409](https://httpstatuses.com/409) | TBD: Something in the request data indicates a conflict with the current state of the resource. See [Concurrency control](#concurrencycontrol) for more information. |
| [410](https://httpstatuses.com/410) | TBD: Requested resource is no longer available. |
| [411](https://httpstatuses.com/411) | TBD: Missing `Content-Length`. This occurs when submitting request data but failing to specify a required `Content-Length` header to declare its size. |
| [412](https://httpstatuses.com/412) | TBD: An Etag or `If-Match` header does not match, indicating the content has been modified since you initially accessed it. See [Concurrency control](#concurrencycontrol) for more information. |
| [413](https://httpstatuses.com/413) | TBD: Request body exceeds maximum allowable size. |
| [415](https://httpstatuses.com/415) | TBD: Unsupported media type. This typically occurs when you request data in the wrong format, such as `text/xml` when the API can only exchange `application/json` data. |
| [423](https://httpstatuses.com/423) | TBD: Requested resource is locked. See [Concurrency control](#concurrencycontrol) for more information. |
| [429](https://httpstatuses.com/429) | TBD: Too many requests. See [Rate limiting](#ratelimiting) for more information. |
| [500](https://httpstatuses.com/500) | TBD: Internal server error. |
| [501](https://httpstatuses.com/501) | TBD: Functionality not supported. |
| [502](https://httpstatuses.com/502) | TBD: Platform timeout error. |
| [503](https://httpstatuses.com/503) | TBD: Too many requests. Service is temporarily unavailable. |
| [507](https://httpstatuses.com/507) | TBD: Insufficient storage for size of request. Try again later. |
