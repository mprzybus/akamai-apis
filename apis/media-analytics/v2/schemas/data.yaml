    properties:
      aggregation:
        type: integer
        description: |
          Time span included in each record, expressed in seconds.
      endTimeInEpoch:
        type: integer
        description: |
          End of the requested time range, in epoch seconds.
      hasMoreData:

        description: |
          Indicates that a constrained set of requested data does not represent the entire set.
      limit:

        description: |
          Maximum number of requested data `rows`.
      offset:
        type: integer
        description: |
          The offset of the row from which the data should start. This is used with overall `limit` to set the point at which a batch of data starts. For example, setting both `offset` and `limit` to `100` selects rows 101-200 from the overall results.
      startTimeInEpoch:
        type: integer
        description: |
          Start of the requested time range, in epoch seconds.
